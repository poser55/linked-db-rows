h2 issues:
    missing tables & data from sakila schema

    fixed:
        difference in type leads to json export "1" of numbers (instead of 1). -> use new json to string conversion
       org.oser.tools.jdbc.DbExporter.retrieveFieldAndValue:
         with h2, when doing a  rs.getObject(i) on a text/varchar field (or on some other field types?), it returns garbage like clob0: SPACE

       links to other tables are not correctly treated -- partially fixed

       org/oser/tools/jdbc/DbImporter.java:157
            json names have wrong case (toLowerCase is wrong) --- but is not the only issue

       some export of data is missing (null from h2,  '2' otherwise)
